# Preprint Format

This is a manuscript / preprint template for Quarto documents. It renders to a PDF document using Typst. 

This template's goal is to

- Look nice
- Be fast
- Just Work
- Be 100% Quarto standards compliant
  - Write manuscripts without worrying about special formatting & metadata
  - Switch to a journal format without changing anything but `format:`

## Installing

To start a new project:

```bash
quarto use template mvuorre/preprint
```
