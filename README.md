# Preprint Format

This is a preprint template for Quarto documents. It renders to .pdf using Typst. This template's goal is to

- Be 100% Quarto standards compliant
  - Users can write and preprint this without worrying about journal-specific formatting guidelines.
  - As soon as a journal is specified, users can switch to any other Quarto format without editing custom YAML or other options (unless that format requires it.)
- Look nice
- Accommodate all required fields typically used for OSF preprint metadata

## Installing

Add template to an existing project:

```bash
quarto add template mvuorre/preprint

To start a new project:

```bash
